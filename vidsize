# Decklin's mencoder bitrate/size calculator for two-pass encoding
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The examples assume you have an mencoder.conf set up with mp3lame
# in VBR mode, and profiles for mpeg4 and x264. {} denotes a choice
# between sets of arguments, and [] represents arguments that are
# entirely optional.
#
# Instructions:
#
#  1. Do cropdetect, check for telecining, then pick a size and estimate
#     bitrate:
#
#     vidsize -g W:H:X:Y -l SECS [-F FPS]
#
#  2. First encode pass:
#
#     mencoder SRC \
#         -vf crop=W:H:X:Y,scale=W:H \
#         {-profile mpeg4 -lavcopts vbitrate=RATE:vpass=1:turbo} \
#         {-profile x264 -x264encopts bitrate=RATE:pass=1:turbo=2} \
#         [-lameopts q=N] \
#         [-sid N -vobsubout NAME] \
#         -passlogfile NAME.log \
#         -o /dev/null
#
#  3. Calculate real bitrate:
#
#     vidsize -g W:H:X:Y -l SECS -f FRAMES -a AUDIO_BYTES [-v SUB_BYTES]
#
#  4. Second encode pass:
#
#     mencoder SRC \
#         -vf crop=W:H:X:Y,scale=W:H \
#         {-profile mpeg4 -lavcopts vbitrate=RATE:vpass=2} \
#         {-profile x264 -x264encopts bitrate=RATE:pass=2} \
#         [-lameopts q=N] \
#         -passlogfile NAME.log \
#         -o NAME.avi
#
#  5. Read below if you are interested in the implementation.

# TODO: Document the command line options.
