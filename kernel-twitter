# This is run from cron. We snag a copy of the banner once per run, and
# then for each flavor defined below, use awk to print out a
# short-and-snappy form of the first line that matches. These outputs
# are sent to confer (found elsewhere in my ~/bin repository), which
# saves them in per-flavor state files and prints them back out if they
# are different from last time. If twerp has something to read on stdin,
# it will post it; otherwise, it will exit gracefully.
#
# If you don't like twitter, you can just remove twerp from the pipeline
# and cron will email you instead. In that case awk is probably overkill.
