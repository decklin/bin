# Run a command n times, spread over some duration with randomly-divided
# sleeps (by default, 1 time over 1 hour).
#
# In most cases, this script will take less than the specified duration
# to complete: once the command has run for the final time, the script
# exits immediately. However, if the command itself takes a long time,
# and subsequent invocations are "behind schedule", then (1) sleeping
# will be skipped (2) the entire script execution may take longer than
# the specified total duration. So, don't make any assumptions about how
# long this script will take to run.
#
# The lengths of the gaps when the script sleeps are calculated using a
# scale factor: the longest sleep will be no more than scale times the
# shortest sleep. If you pass a scale of 1, all gaps will be equal, so
# for the default settings (1 time, 1 hour) you will get a sleep of
# exactly 30 minutes. Specifying --scale 59, on the other hand, will
# yield a sleep of somewhere between 1 and 59 minutes. The default scale
# is 9, so a single run will happen somewhere between 10% and 90% into
# the duration.
