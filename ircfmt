# Naively breaks long lines in the input, without refilling. If a line
# contains an IRC nick, the nick is right-justified and any output lines
# broken out from the input line are indented to line up with the text
# following it. Timestamps (or anything else) can be placed before the
# nick, but they will only look good if they are all the same length.

# Pad the nick (%15s), by adding the largest possible number of spaces
# and then eating up extra ones with a backtrack match.
